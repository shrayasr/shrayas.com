# Weeknotes - 2024-W01

I'm going to try to write weeknotes this year. I don't know how long this streak will last, but eh, _"Ever tried, ever failed, no matter. Try again, fail again, fail better"_.

I will start a draft at the start of the week (or whenever in the week I have something to write) and fill them on till Sunday and publish them on Sunday night (?).

- Started listening to Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir again. This has now become somewhat of a comfort book for me, maybe I will start every new year with this? 🤷🏾
- Got invited to do a talk at a conference which has largely students and I think I have the perfect talk for this. More later once things happen/don't, hopefully 🤞🏾
- Bought a Sony WH-CH720N noise cancellation headphones. I hope this is the last pair in my search for something that just-works™️ for (1) taking calls (2) listening to music and (3) easy switching between devices. I'm excited that I can do this: 
    - Pause music playing on my computer
    - Pick up call on mobile, finish conversation
    - Play music playing on my computer
