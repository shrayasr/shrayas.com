# Weeknotes - 2025-W02

![Cover image for 2025-W02](_images/cover-2025-w02.jpg)

- Joined one of those "Book challenge"s on Goodreads and set myself a goal of 12 books for this year. Given that I'm just developing my reading habit, I don't want to go wild. I'd rather be conservative and keep my goals achieveable.
- Started listening to [Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12262741-wild). This is a book Prasanna wanted to read, so I thought I'd read it along with her, so that we have more things to talk about.
- Tried [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) for a small requirement for a project and am rather impressed with it. But the use case was very tiny. I will try it for a more complex use case next before making more concrete thoughts.
