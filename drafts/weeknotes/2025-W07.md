# Weeknotes - 2025-W07

![Cover image for 2025-W07](/weeknotes/_images/cover-2025-w07.jpg)

Prasanna and I spent about 2h setting up our new Ikea bookshelf ([BILLY / OXBERG](https://www.ikea.com/in/en/p/billy-oxberg-bookcase-with-glass-doors-brown-walnut-effect-s39483629/)). A dear friend kindly shipped it to us from Hyderabad. I was quite scared how it would arrive, but everything was A-OK. No scratches, nothing. It weighed about 60 kilos and the charge was â‚¹2,400. He shipped it to us via **movemate**.

FIL was an ardent and voracious reader who read widely and without bias. Since this is our first bookshelf ever, I wanted the first book in it to be his favourite - [Fountainhead - Ayn Rand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138743946).

It still baffles me that I have to refer to him in the past tense. I wish he were around to see this bookshelf - he would have loved it so much. I still remember how when we moved in to our current place and called him over after we set it up - he looked around for a few minutes and asked us _"where are the books"_. It didn't matter to him where the furniture was but it mattered to him where the books were. I just miss him so terribly.
