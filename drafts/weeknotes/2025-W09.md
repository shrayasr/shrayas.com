# Weeknotes - 2025-W09

On Monday, Prasanna's phone (my father's old Galaxy Flip 5) stopped working. The screen just wouldn't respond. Thankfully I was able to salvage a lot of the data and ensure backups were properly taken via a keyboard that I connected to the computer. I set up another new phone for her and tried the [Niagra Launcher](https://niagaralauncher.app/) which she seems to be liking just fine. I'm sure that the _repair_ is going to cost 10s of thousands of â‚¹. New tech is _cool_ but new tech is also _expensive_ in all sorts of ways.

I had a wonderful call on Tuesday night with a GCPP batchmate about an upcoming project that we both are planning to work on together. I think its going to be amazing. More details closer to launch.

We've got an AC fixed in our hall, this was my parents' old AC from their old home. They shifted to a new one recently where they bought new ACs. Hopefully we can make judicial use of this during the summers to beat the good ol Chennai heat.

Got in 1.5h of Badminton for the week. Decided to not do another session because there is a LOT to study for the saturday classes and I wanted to give it my best.

I wanted to get back into reading RSS feeds, missing a lot of weeknotes from great folks so I am giving [YARR](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr) a shot this time. Wanted something that sits on my desktop, since that is where I do most of my reading. Experience report once I use it for a while.
