## 🏡

I was born in the city of Bengaluru. And I've spent a large part of my
childhood & adulthood in Chennai which is where I currently stay. Both cities
have played a HUGE role in making me who I am today - from friendships, love,
life lessons, and whatnot.

## 💻

As far back as I can remember, I've always had a thing for computers. I still
remember running a few DOS based commands to launch Prince of Persia and play
it along with my father. He was also the man who introduced me to other
classics like Dangerous Dave, DOOM and Wolfenstien 3D. This interest lived on
in me and I ended up pursuing 2 courses in the Computer Sciences.

The open source community has played quite a large role in my life - it helps
to keep me rooted to the ground and that I still have a lot to learn. Another
thing is that it assures me that a bunch of completely random people from
around the world can come together on an idea and just work on it, irrespective
of any barriers that humanity has set up for itself. Which is why I always try
and take time out to contribute where ever I can.

## 🏃🏾‍♂️

Since 2014, I've developed a large attraction towards the outdoors. It all
started with a spontaneous (and rather stupid minded) decision to go on a 10
day trek in the Himalayas. This set me down a path and since then, I've picked
up Ultra Running as my sport of choice. The simple act of putting one foot 
ahead of another for distances longer than 42 kilometers excites me and scares
me at the same time.
