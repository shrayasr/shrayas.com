Hello,

Welcome to my space on the internet. My idea for this space is for me to be
able to express myself. You will find technical articles interspersed with
stories about my runs and my life.

I enjoy working with computers and currently, I head the engineering efforts at
[Logic Soft](https://logicsoft.co.in) - a small organization with a large
impact.  Logic Soft is the only recognized software providers for the Book
Trade businesses in India. If you have ever gone to a book store, it is very
likely that Logic Soft's software is running their business behind the scenes.
Don't believe me? Check out our [clients](https://logicsoft.co.in/clients).

Here, I am responsible for all key technical decisions in setting the
foundation for building the next generation of web and mobile applications. I
enjoy building simple and future proof software with a focus on readability and
scalability. I strongly believe that new technologies are not the right way to
solve problems - simple design is.

I am also tremendously passionate about teaching and mentoring, which I believe
is the only real way to affect any kind of change - along with difficult
conversations. I fail tremendously at it, but I am confident that in time, I
will be able to get better with it.

If I'm not in front of a computer, it is very likely that I will be out on
the trails running absurd distances or in the kitchen cooking up one of my
many experiments.
