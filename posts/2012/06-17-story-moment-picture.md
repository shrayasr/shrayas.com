# A Story, A Moment, A Picture

Its been a really long time since I wrote something.. I guess I lacked
that push, I guess I was focussing on other things. But today, I got
that push.  
  
7:25PM, was just chilling in my room taking some classes on Natural
Language Processing when I got a call "Macha, I'm in Bangalore, come
lets shoot"   
  
8:05PM, Brigade Road, I met Waseem. Its been a while since we met and
shot together. He's one of those people I really look up to simply
because everytime we shoot together.. He inspires me to try new things
and to think differently. Hell I still cant stand beside him and shoot
properly, I'm so intimidated by him :) He's really good.   
  
So as we're walking along the roads, looking for shots.. we bitch
about those 'wannabe' photographers carrying around that hideous Canon
EOS edge bag that they get for free. They really do not understand what
photography is all about.. Maybe some of them do, but most of them
don't. And I will try to explain it today.  
  
We walked and came across to this street, and it had this amazing old
stone kinda building that hosted a fancy suit shop. We were trying our
hand at some shots there when this kid came along. He was curious, and
wanted to see what it is that we were doing. So Waseem immediately said
"Macha, i'm shooting him" and that's when it all started.   
  
"John Peter", a kid who earned Rs. 100 - Rs. 200 a day by collecting
parking fare. He started telling us his story. He told us that his dad
had passed away and that he gives all this money to his mom. We had some
wonderful conversations with the kid. Well I was silent for most of it
(im a useless introvert) but I was a part of all of it. Waseem then made
him write his name on a piece of paper and hold it up for us to get
shots.   
  
Incident light from the left illuminating half his face, ISO at 1600, F
1.8, Shutter at 1/200th of a second. He, just standing there,
composed, just posing for the 2nd time in his life. Last someone took
a picture of him was 4 years ago when some white guy had visited it
seems. I had got my shot.

After every quick session, he asked us to show him what we had taken and
always smiled at the shots.. We knew he liked them the instant we saw
that smile.   
  
Photographers these days, open up pages on facebook just as they know
how to handle a camera and start putting up pictures.. I think this is
really fucked up and that they really shouldn't be doing so.
Photography is something that takes YEARS to gain mastery over. More
over its something that is SO highly subjective that one should
understand his likes first before he can start publishing his work to
the world.   
  
Photography isn't about getting money.  
Photography isn't about getting those 1000000000000 likes on your
pictures  
Photography isn't about someone else appreciating your work  
  
It is about you, the moment and the story that revolves around it.   
  
To me, Photography is my passion and today I rediscovered it. Its so
wonderful when you're standing there talking to a person who earns 100
bucks a day and gives it away to his mom. He studies whenever he can
and managed to write his entire name in English. I think that standing
there, listening to him narrate his story, itself, to me, was the
perfect shot.   
  
No light, No ISO, No Shutter speed, No Aperture. Just a story.
That's how I perceive photography.
