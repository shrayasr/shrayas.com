# The Secret of Ultra Running

The more I get involved with ultra running and more so running in general, the
more I get the sense that there is no secret to it. It feels as if asking an
*ace* ultra runner what their secret is, would never get us any real meaningful
answer.

Start by making a plan. Then show up everyday, execute the plan and move on
with your day. Do it today, do it tomorrow, do it the day after. Once you're at
a point where you've achieved what you initially planned out for, repeat the
whole process again with a new plan - Rinse, dry & Repeat

The real secret sauce, if any, is made up of patience, the power to persevere
and commitment to the cause. A cause that underlies the answer to a question
you've probably been asked a hundred times before - *"Why do you run so
much?".* Maybe this is the true secret to everything in life. That there is
none. There's only effort. There's only time. There's only patience. 

Life needn't be so complex :)
