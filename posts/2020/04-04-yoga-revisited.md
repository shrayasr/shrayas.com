# Yoga Revisited

When I started with my training plan, yoga wasn't exactly my strong point. I
couldn't flow, I couldn't even sustain a pose, I never felt like I was doing
anything at all. I never felt like I "worked out". My coach asked to believe in
the practice and to give it my best. And, I continued to try. It's been about a
year now that I started this journey and things have changed so much. Just this
week, I was able to keep up with the instructor on 2 full sessions. Flowing
with them, and my breath. I was able to hold my poses. I was able to breathe
deep. I was able to do everything that I thought was *hard*. I'm able to truly
feel the asana inside of me.

Today, I went from a fold to a tree pose and I just had this burst of gratitude
in me. As if, it finally clicked. I've come a long way in this journey of the
mind and the body. And today I feel proud of it. The path ahead doesn't scare
me anymore, I know that if I put my effort into it and show up to my mat, my
body will listen. It will move, it will flow. 

I'm so tremendously excited for what lies ahead. It's been such a humbling
journey within. And I owe it all to discipline, effort, trust of my coach and
the space around me that allowed me to fail.
