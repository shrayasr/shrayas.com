# To disagree is human

![](/images/_disagree.webp)

Let’s first talk about opinions. I feel that our place of birth, parental
upbringing, our religion, privileges, peer groups, our choices, the books we
read and the algorithms that we interact with everyday go a long way to start
and later mould our opinions. As we grow, our opinions grow with us and these
opinions are our safety net, our community and the window through which we
learn to see the world. Because each one of us grow up in different
circumstances, our opinions are different as well. I find it fascinating that
someone as “close” as twins, can grow up with radically different points of
view too.

It is because we found ways to convey our opinions and have a conversation
about them, that we are able to live healthier, live longer, peer into the
smallest corners of our bodies and travel into the farthest reaches of space. I
am sure that not everyone agreed with each other, but they got to where they
wished to, together. 

Disagreements form the bedrock of successful friendships, successful
relationships and most importantly - progress of thought.

One of the primary reason why I think we find it easier to talk about this is
over being able to practice it, is because we are enshrined, from an early age
with the bias of **appeal to authority**. Examples of which look like:

- My parents told me to do it, so I do.
- My teacher told me to do it, so I do.
- Society told me to do it, so I do.
- My boss told me to do it, so I do.
- My religion told me to do it, so I do. 

Disagreeing with any of these, is showing a lack of respect, is “talking above
your age”, is avoiding conflict, is blasphemy.

But why? Why are disagreements not OK? Can it not be that I value you, but do
not share your opinion? Can my lived reality not tell me differently? Why don’t
we converse about it? Heck, we can still hold the same opinions we did when we
started, but do we not owe it to each other, to hear the other one out, fully?
Is there an assumption that we know better? 

To illustrate, I have very strong opinions when it comes to my [lack of belief
in god & religion](/my-lack-of-faith), the patriarchal structures perpetrated
by men holding both men and women within its grasp, the years of suffering
endured by people in the name of the caste system among many others. However I
do understand that these are the result of **my** influences and as much as I
am entitled to mine, there might be more nuances to this that I am missing. 

I think maybe this is because we have an obsession with classifying things as
**right** and **wrong.** The more I observe, the more I see the world being
filled with shades of gray. But greys are uncomfortable and it is more
_comfortable_ to choose one among the 2 sides of the coin and hold your ground.
It is more peaceful, we have a tribe here - we tell ourselves. However, the
great things about grey things, is that we can see the world for all its messy
complexity and give ourselves the chance to look at things without the
compulsion of putting them into buckets. 

Some of my closest friends do not share my points of view as strongly as I do.
Yet they are the ones I go to, when I need help. Why? Because my opinions are
not what make the entire sum of me. And their opinions are not what make the
entire sum of them. Because when they disagree with me, they are disagreeing
with my opinion. Their claim isn’t that Shrayas is a bad person. 

Looking back, I feel disagreements are what have helped me grow - to find the
nuance in my argument, to understand the nuance in theirs. It is impossible for
me to know everything and that’s the beauty of disagreements and of
conversations where disagreements are possible - you open the floor for
learning. My world view, allows me to see things in one way and my
conversations allow me to slip into someone else’s world view, to see what the
point of view looks like - maybe I have missed something, maybe they have.
Being able to have such conversations has allowed me to reflect if my biases
are too strong, if I’m not considering another obvious point of view or if I am
thinking too much from my privileges. It has empowered me, to be open enough to
disagree with my own opinions - to lay them bare, and inspect their origins and
their stories. 

And hence, my wish is for all of us to disagree more with each other,
respectfully, fruitfully and mindfully. One simple (?) way I trained myself to
do it, is to be a better listener. More often than not, because we take
ourselves more seriously than we take others, we are listening to respond
and not listening to listen. I have found that when I listen to listen, I
end up being able to better put myself in someone else’s shoes rather than
hold the supposed moral high ground to “win” the argument. Listening allows
me to disagree better - because I can _parse_ the argument better, because
I can let it _sit_ in me before responding. Of course this only works when
it goes both ways - if one listens to respond and the other listens to
listen - then we’re not going anywhere.

The only caveat I’d add here is that there is such a thing called core
ideologies that I dare say **must** match. For example: You and I may disagree
about the way to _reach_ equity in society, but if we cannot agree that society
and its power structures favours men over everyone else, then we must first
address that disagreement moving on. Of course this also means that we may
never agree on something, and that’s OK too, our relationship allowing.

With all that said, let’s show each other our worlds and share how we came to
inhabit them. Allow me to pick a sapling from yours and you can from me. Let us
disagree about why the mountains in my world are more rugged or why the rivers
in yours run clearer. Let us break from the circles of rights and wrongs
because your rivers have kept you as sane as my mountains have. Maybe in this
journey of trading disagreements, we can get to a place together, where I have
more clearer rivers and you have more rugged mountains. Let us disagree more,
let us learn to live more amongst the greys, because we are unique humans with
unique histories and because to disagree, is human.
