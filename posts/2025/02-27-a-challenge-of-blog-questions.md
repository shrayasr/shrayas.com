# A challenge of blog questions

Not been around on the blogosphere for long enough to ever get _tagged_ but I'm so glad that I got my first tag. Thanks, [Sathya](https://sathyabh.at/blogging-challenge-blog-questions/)!

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I've always wanted to say things out loud. Growing up, I always felt unheard. A blog gave me the space to voice my thoughts, my feelings in the raw-est way possible. My first blog was over on blogger and it was really raw. I had some really nonsense opinions over there - a lot of which I don't carry with me right now, but it was as much me, as the current blog represents me.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it? Have you blogged on other platforms before?

I started over on blogger. Ironically, I think I blogged **much much more** on that platform because it was _easy_. 

I then graduated to some static site generators - [Pelican](https://getpelican.com/) and then to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) but having to write somewhere, and run a bunch of commands to **publish** just added too much to my already existing inertia and I just didn't blog all that much. In hindsight, a SSG was just a terrible idea. For me, the gap between though and writing should be as less as possible, and only then will I sit down to write anything. Consider this blog post - it wouldn't have been written had I not known that if I throw this file in a directory, the tool will take care of making it accessible on the web for me. Maybe I've gotten old ü§∑üèæ

Currently, I blog using [Blot](https://blot.im/) which I've found to be a wonderful balance between the static site generators and full fledged CMS'. Just write things in text (ish) files in a directory inside dropbox / google drive, and Blot does the rest for you. It just works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that‚Äôs part of your blog?

I write everything inside VSCode. I want to move to something like [Typora](http://typora.io/) because VSCode is also my everyday _editor_ for work and it is getting annoying to switch folders. 

Note: See what I mean by gap between thought to writing? I am a hard customer.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

Mostly when I am sitting alone, after finishing everything for the day, with some music in my ear.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

I have 2 levels of drafts - one in my head, and one in my folders. The number of head-drafts are much much larger than the folder-drafts .. something I wish to get cracking on sooner than later. 

In my [GCPP course](https://school.takshashila.org.in/gcpp) we were taught something called _freewriting_ where you just set a timer and **dump**. I start all my posts that way, and in drafts. Once all said dumpage is over, I sleep on it and edit it the next day and publish. I need to take myself less seriously, and having this tight deadline to publish, helps.

## What‚Äôs your favorite post on your blog?

I think it has to be [Your toughest opponent, best friend and strongest competition](/your-toughest-opponent-best-friend-and-strongest-competition). Its one of those things that successfully went from idea-in-head to remember-the-experience to write-about-the-experience. 

It is a reminder to me, of what I can do when I put my mind to it.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

Write, write, write, write. 

Thanks to folks like [Thejesh](https://thejeshgn.com/), Sathya, [Divya](https://divyashivaram.substack.com/) et al, I've been pretty regular at doing [WeekNotes](https://shrayas.com/tagged/weeknotes) since the start of this year. I hope to keep up with it! 

## Who‚Äôs next?

Tag, you're it [Vinay Keerthi](https://stonecharioteer.com/). Come out of that slumber!
