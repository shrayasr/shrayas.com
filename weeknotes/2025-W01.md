# Weeknotes - 2025-W01

![Cover image for 2025-W01](/weeknotes/_images/cover-2025-w01.jpg)

I'm going to try to write weeknotes this year. I don't know how long this streak will last, but eh, _"Ever tried, ever failed, no matter. Try again, fail again, fail better"_.

I will start a draft at the start of the week (or whenever in the week I have something to write) and fill them on till Sunday and publish them on Sunday night (?).

- Started listening to Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir again. This has now become somewhat of a comfort book for me, maybe I will start every new year with this? ü§∑üèæ
- Got invited to do a talk at a conference which has largely students and I think I have the perfect talk for this. More later once things happen/don't, hopefully ü§ûüèæ
- Bought a Sony WH-CH720N noise cancellation headphones. I hope this is the last pair in my search for something that just-works‚Ñ¢Ô∏è for (1) taking calls (2) listening to music and (3) easy switching between devices. I'm excited that I can do this: 
    - Pause music playing on my computer
    - Pick up call on mobile, finish conversation
    - Play music playing on my computer

    ü§Ø
- After a shitty month of coughs (I have an allergic bronchitis) and infections, I finally started walking again. Need to start runs soon. I miss them so damn much.
- The new year wasn't happy at all. I lost my father in law in July of 2024 (more on that sometime) and this season was the one he enjoyed the most in the city. But a year is more than one day, I have hope for the next 364.25 days.
- Happened upon [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) which is an e-ink screen that you can send data to. Looks interesting and will fit for an idea I have in mind. Costs $129 ~ Rs. 12,000. 
- Finished my first book of 2025 - a (second) re-read of [Project Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary). The science and story enthusiast in me just perks up everytime I pick this up. Absolutely highly recommended.
- Went to the Chennai Book Fair on 4th Jan with the team. Thought it'd be nice for the bulk of them to see people actually using their work. It was nice to suggest and buy books for the team as well, I hope they enjoy it as much as I did, when I read them / about them. 
    - Bought 2 books myself, will go again with Prasanna and maybe pick more up at that time.
- Finished my second book of 2025 - [We Should All Be Feminists](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738563-we-should-all-be-feminists) by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I have heard the TED talk long ago, and found it to be a fantastic introduction to the ideas of "Feminism". Maybe this will be the book I suggest to folks who ask me what Feminism is?
