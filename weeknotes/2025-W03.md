# Weeknotes - 2025-W03

Watched the movie adaptation of the book I read last week - [Wild](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2305051/) and it was SOOOOO bad. It was even nomiated for 2 oscars ðŸ˜±. Maybe I just didn't get it or I was biased from the book, but it was a total meh movie. I generally REALLY enjoy Reese Witherspoon's acting but it felt like she was totally flat from start to finish. 

Even though IT is a very high paying profession, I notice a presumption from a large % of the folks that I interact with at $work that IT is _easy_. So the assumption would be something like _"But this is just doing X and Y. Why does it take PQR number of days?"_. Is this just me? Or is this more common? 

GCPP is intense. The amount of studying that I have to do before every Saturday's classes is **insane**. The intensity is fun though, and I haven't _studied_ something in a long while so it might just be the initial getting-used-to period. But I'm thinking a lot more and observing a lot more of the world around me. So it feels wonderful. 

On 19th, I went to the [Hindu Lit for Life](https://www.thehindu.com/lit-for-life/) festival with Prasanna and another friend and had a great time. Got to listen to Aruna Roy talk to TM Krishna and also got to meet and tell [Krish Ashok](https://x.com/krishashok) and share with him that it was the Seen and the Unseen [episode](https://seenunseen.in/episodes/2023/8/21/episode-343-we-are-all-amits-from-africa/) with him & [Narendra Shenoy](https://x.com/shenoyn) that brought a lot of laughs and solace to a very partner-missing-altitude-sick me back during my solo trip in August 2023 to Leh. It was wonderful to talk to him briefly and listen to him in his session too. A fun day! 

Otherwise it was a very _normal_ week - mostly just wake up - workout - work - home - study - sleep kind of a week.
