# Weeknotes - 2025-W04

![Cover image for 2025-W04](/weeknotes/_images/cover-2025-w04.jpg)

I've started reading [Maybe You Should Talk to Someone](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570546-maybe-you-should-talk-to-someone) by Lori Gottlieb. It has been a wonderful read thus far. 

So after finishing _Wild: A Journey from Lost to Found_ last week, I was just looking through Cheryl's feed .. and found out that she's sympathetic to Israel in the war against Palestine. It really saddened me to see that a writer whose work that I really really loved, has this stance - ah well 🤷🏾. 

> From the river to the sea...

Had a meeting with the GCPP "squad" (sub teams) on Monday morning and it was nice to see the tight group of people i'll probably be working with a lot over the next few months. The team is so vibrant with folks from all walks of life - very exciting. We need to work on an assignment that needs to be submitted on Thursday so we had an initial discussion around that. 

I finished up my part of the GCPP assignment submission and am thoroughly unhappy with it. I haven't written anything outside of life and tech so I think I need to find my voice here. It also emphasized to me, the for-grantedness of writing in a particular space for long. Given that I've written so much about and in tech, I understand the assumptions and the audience better. Here, I don't know what assumptions I _can_ make so I find myself struggling a lot. Its the process I guess and it will take time.

- Working with a team makes this experience so much better. I get to read and understand POVs from people who are far more well versed in this than me.

The [New Delhi World Book Fair](https://www.nbtindia.gov.in/ndwbf2025/) is coming up and work is quite hectic on that front - we need to figure out the stall flex, the handouts we're going to take and all the other effort that we're going to be putting in for our stall presence. I will be at the fair from Feb 4 to Feb 7. It has become one of my most favourite times of the year. 

Happy Republic Day, India! We've now been a republic for 75 long years. I did a short talk on this at my parents' community where I spoke for about 5 minutes about what it means to be a _Republic_ and some unknown facts about our wonderful constitution. ~~I ended it by reciting the preamble which I want to quote here, so that I can be re-reminded of what we must keep in mind, as we build the new India~~. I decided to make the video public so here you go:
