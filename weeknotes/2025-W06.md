# Weeknotes - 2025-W06

![Cover image for 2025-W06](/weeknotes/_images/cover-2025-w06.jpg)

This week was so fast, and so much that I couldn't make time to fill this weeknote up through the week (as I usually do). I'm sitting here and writing this on the Sunday trying to recall it all. I will definitely gloss over the nuances because I am absolutely terrible at remembering things. 

On Tuesday, I left to Delhi for the New Delhi World Book Fair. My cousin who stays near Delhi picked us up from the airport and we had a nice meal and went to see the India Gate. Ended the day with catching up with my father and colleagues about the happenings in the book fair since it started. 

I'm really surprised (and not surprised simultaneously?) about how bad the air quality is in Delhi. I'm no Bryan Johnson, but the situation is REALLY grim. I couldn't breathe well without an N95 mask. I went out for a walk every morning that I was in Delhi and it was nice to walk in such cool climate albeit hard because of the AQI and the mask.

The inital plan was to spend 2 full days at the fair, but thanks to the Delhi elections, the fair was closed on the 5th (üòí) and that left me with only one day to do all the meeting and all the picking up of books. Picked up a bunch for Prasanna and I, and a few books for friends as well. The fair really is wonderful and exhaustive. One day isn't enough to cover all the stalls that are there. 

The weekend was jam packed with the Takshashila conference. It was a long, intense, packed 2 days with loads of interesting stuff. I got to listen to one of the people I look up to the most and I hope that someday, I'll get to work with them too!  

Also got some time to squeeze in a quick hang with some wonderful friends on Saturday night.
