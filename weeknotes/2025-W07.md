# Weeknotes - 2025-W07

Prasanna and I spent about 2h setting up our new Ikea bookshelf ([BILLY / OXBERG](https://www.ikea.com/in/en/p/billy-oxberg-bookcase-with-glass-doors-brown-walnut-effect-s39483629/)). A dear friend kindly shipped it to us from Hyderabad. I was quite scared how it would arrive, but everything was A-OK. No scratches, nothing. It weighed about 60 kilos and the charge was ‚Çπ2,400. He shipped it to us via **movemate**.

FIL was an ardent and voracious reader who read widely and without bias. Since this is our first bookshelf ever, I wanted the first book in it to be his favourite - [Fountainhead - Ayn Rand](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138743946).

It still baffles me that I have to refer to him in the past tense. I wish he were around to see this bookshelf - he would have loved it so much. I still remember how when we moved in to our current place and called him over after we set it up - he looked around for a few minutes and asked us _"where are the books"_. It didn't matter to him where the furniture was but it mattered to him where the books were. I just miss him so terribly. 

Been working on a few projects on the GCPP front - one as part of my community engagement course work and one with a course mate. Quite excited for both, lots of work to do, but looking forward to it all üòä.

The community engagement is an assignment that I'm supposed to do with 10 other people. I sent out the email for this and felt a huge wave of gratitude. Maybe this will be my first email towards a life of _public_ policy? I hope that I can quote this to myself many years in the future and say, as Sheldon taught us all to say - _"I informed you thusly"_. ü§ûüèæ

Played badminton üè∏ twice this week - one for 1.5h and one for 1h. Quite happy that I'm getting to play more often these days. A dear friend always said that sport was how he made more friends and has taught him much. I didn't play sport much growing up because of many reasons, but badminton has always been the exception to that rule. Between playing badminton and being able to run - never does a day go by, that I don't think about his words. Ironically though, we haven't played much sport together and now he lives about 7000KM away and I dearly wish that I can do that sometime soon with him.

Just after writing the above paragraph ‚§¥Ô∏è, the next day I did my first "run" after many many months. So grateful for a body that allows me to put one leg in front of the other. Back to long distances, soon üí™üèæ

My parents took the final steps towards vacating the house that I grew up in. It was bittersweet. So much of me was formed there, so much that I carry with me now, and so much that I wish to outgrow out of. Thank you, C6, for everything.
