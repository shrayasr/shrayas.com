# Weeknotes - 2025-W08

This week was one of the most hectic weeks that I've had so far. Just too many things going on. 

I was supposed to travel with my parents to Bangalore (and then on to Tumkur) on Tuesday morning. When my father was boarding the train, a man who was tailing him since he got into the station, barged in and flicked his phone. Father had saved up and bought a Samsung Fold 6. Phones are basically his vice and he enjoys them a lot. It was a really unfortunate experience to have. I was very thankful that nothing untowardly happened to both my parents and they weren't hurt physically. This was followed by us going to the railway police station (VERY badly maintained; absolutely horrible), lodging a complaint and then checking the CCTV footage to find out that it was a dude who followed him since he entered the station. I don't have any hopes on the police department however, that they will find this. 

The same night was my community organization exercise with 8 of my friends. my topic was on **Third Spaces** and the brief was like this: 

> **Third spaces and the need for more of it**
> 
> Third spaces were coined by the sociologist 'Ray Oldenburg' as the next space after the first - home and second - work. Third spaces are for the community and society to come together and socialize with each other. A good example of this are parks and beaches.
>
> We simultaneously live in a very connected and disconnected world. We find it easier to confine ourselves to the first and second spaces out of habit and necessity. The large majority of us meet our friends and family either at someone's home or at a movie or for some food. It is very unlikely that we're all at a _third_ space, having a picnic or just spending time together. Not to mention, movies and food cost money, which acts as a reverse incentive towards spending more time together.
>
> I would like to explore the idea of third spaces together - specifically from the Indian context. Why we need such spaces, where we are, what we have done and what remains to be done. We will observe how third spaces are maintained across the world to draw some references too. 

It was a great session and featured people from different walks of life. I felt most grateful to be able to put together a circle of 8 people, to talk about this to. This is my first _public_ engagement and I hope to do much much more in the future.

Managed to play badminton üè∏ twice a week again - quite happy about this. 

I also went and attended a talk by [Karthik Muralidharan](https://x.com/karthik_econ) at the Madras School of Economics. 2 things: 

1. I didn't know there was a Madras School of Economics.
2. The talk was wonderful. A large part of the reason why I am studying public policy today is Karthik (among others).

The specialization part of my course started this Saturday. Had wonderful sessions. The next 7 weeks are going to be hectic, and fun! Absolutely looking forward to it.

Today (Sunday) was Prasanna's birthday. The first out without her hero. She turned 35. Happy birthday, my love. I wish you much strength as you learn to (re) build a life with his values but without his presence.
